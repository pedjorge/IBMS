Hi all,

This consists of the project my team (Audrey, Jason, Mark) developed for our 2nd year team project for Software Engineering.

To compile: javac -cp IBMS/mysql-connector.jar:.:.. IBMS/windows/.java javac -cp IBMS/mysql-connector.jar:.:.. IBMS/.java

If you get any error messages when compiling, remove ALL .class files from IBMS and IBMS/windows, and compile again in the above order.

To Run: java -cp IBMS/mysql-connector.jar:.:.. IBMS/IBMS

Remmember - you must be connected to University VPN!
